# RISC-V-Simulator

## Simple RISC-V Simulator that implements RISCV32i (integer only) subset

The RISC-V simulator accepts a binary file of compiled RISC-V32I assembly code. 
The simulator will read the binary file into an int array and subsequently loop through until 
all instructions have been handled. The following RISC-V instructions are supported:
